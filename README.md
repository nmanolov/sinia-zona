# Blue Zone

This project visualizes the two parking zones (and their subzones) in Sofia on a map, as the information on the site of by the municipality is lacking in interactivity.

Also contains a super basic tool for editing what you see and then downloading the updated source for the zones 

There is a singe point of truth - [zones.json](./src/zones.json), that contains the geometries of all the subzones.
